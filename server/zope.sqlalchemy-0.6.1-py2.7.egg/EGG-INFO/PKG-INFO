        Introduction
        ============
        
        The aim of this package is to unify the plethora of existing packages
        integrating SQLAlchemy with Zope's transaction management. As such it seeks
        only to provide a data manager and makes no attempt to define a `zopeish` way
        to configure engines.
        
        For WSGI applications, Zope style automatic transaction management is
        available with `repoze.tm2`_, a part of `Repoze BFG`_ and `Turbogears 2`_.
        
        You need to understand `SQLAlchemy`_ for this package and this README to make 
        any sense.

        Running the tests
        =================
        
        This package is distributed as a buildout. Using your desired python run:
        
        $ python bootstrap.py
        
        This will download the dependent packages and setup the test script, which may
        be run with:
        
        $ ./bin/test
        
        or with the standard setuptools test command:
        
        $ ./bin/py setup.py test
        
        To enable testing with your own database set the TEST_DSN environment variable
        to your sqlalchemy database dsn. Two-phase commit behaviour may be tested by
        setting the TEST_TWOPHASE variable to a non empty string. e.g:
        
        $ TEST_DSN=postgres://test:test@localhost/test TEST_TWOPHASE=True bin/test
        
        Example
        =======
        
        This example is lifted directly from the SQLAlchemy declarative documentation.
        First the necessary imports.
        
            >>> from sqlalchemy import *
            >>> from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
            >>> from sqlalchemy.orm import scoped_session, sessionmaker, relation
            >>> from zope.sqlalchemy import ZopeTransactionExtension
            >>> import transaction
        
        Now to define the mapper classes.
        
            >>> Base = declarative_base()
            >>> class User(Base):
            ...     __tablename__ = 'test_users'
            ...     id = Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True)
            ...     name = Column('name', String(50))
            ...     addresses = relation("Address", backref="user")
            >>> class Address(Base):
            ...     __tablename__ = 'test_addresses'
            ...     id = Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True)
            ...     email = Column('email', String(50))
            ...     user_id = Column('user_id', Integer, ForeignKey('test_users.id'))
        
        Create an engine and setup the tables. Note that for this example to work a 
        recent version of sqlite/pysqlite is required. 3.4.0 seems to be sufficient.
        
            >>> engine = create_engine(TEST_DSN, convert_unicode=True)
            >>> Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
        
        Now to create the session itself. As zope is a threaded web server we must use
        scoped sessions. Zope and SQLAlchemy sessions are tied together by using the
        ZopeTransactionExtension from this package.
        
            >>> Session = scoped_session(sessionmaker(bind=engine,
            ... twophase=TEST_TWOPHASE, extension=ZopeTransactionExtension()))
        
        Call the scoped session factory to retrieve a session. You may call this as
        many times as you like within a transaction and you will always retrieve the
        same session. At present there are no users in the database.
        
            >>> session = Session()
            >>> session.query(User).all()
            []
        
        We can now create a new user and commit the changes using Zope's transaction
        machinary, just as Zope's publisher would.
        
            >>> session.add(User(id=1, name='bob'))
            >>> transaction.commit()
        
        Engine level connections are outside the scope of the transaction integration.
        
            >>> engine.connect().execute('SELECT * FROM test_users').fetchall()
            [(1, ...'bob')]
        
        A new transaction requires a new session. Let's add an address.
        
            >>> session = Session()
            >>> bob = session.query(User).all()[0]
            >>> bob.name
            u'bob'
            >>> bob.addresses
            []
            >>> bob.addresses.append(Address(id=1, email='bob@bob.bob'))
            >>> transaction.commit()
            >>> session = Session()
            >>> bob = session.query(User).all()[0]
            >>> bob.addresses
            [<Address object at ...>]
            >>> bob.addresses[0].email
            u'bob@bob.bob'
            >>> bob.addresses[0].email = 'wrong@wrong'    
        
        To rollback a transaction, use transaction.abort().
        
            >>> transaction.abort()
            >>> session = Session()
            >>> bob = session.query(User).all()[0]
            >>> bob.addresses[0].email
            u'bob@bob.bob'
            >>> transaction.abort()
        
        By default, zope.sqlalchemy puts sessions in an 'active' state when they are
        first used. ORM write operations automatically move the session into a
        'changed' state. This avoids unnecessary database commits. Sometimes it
        is necessary to interact with the database directly through SQL. It is not
        possible to guess whether such an operation is a read or a write. Therefore we
        must manually mark the session as changed when manual SQL statements write
        to the DB.
        
            >>> session = Session()
            >>> conn = session.connection()
            >>> users = Base.metadata.tables['test_users']
            >>> conn.execute(users.update(users.c.name=='bob'), name='ben')
            <sqlalchemy.engine.base.ResultProxy object at ...>
            >>> from zope.sqlalchemy import mark_changed
            >>> mark_changed(session)
            >>> transaction.commit()
            >>> session = Session()
            >>> session.query(User).all()[0].name
            u'ben'
            >>> transaction.abort()
        
        If this is a problem you may tell the extension to place the session in the
        'changed' state initially.
        
            >>> Session.configure(extension=ZopeTransactionExtension('changed'))
            >>> Session.remove()
            >>> session = Session()
            >>> conn = session.connection()
            >>> conn.execute(users.update(users.c.name=='ben'), name='bob')
            <sqlalchemy.engine.base.ResultProxy object at ...>
            >>> transaction.commit()
            >>> session = Session()
            >>> session.query(User).all()[0].name
            u'bob'
            >>> transaction.abort()
        
        Development version
        ===================
        
        `SVN version <svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/zope.sqlalchemy/trunk#egg=zope.sqlalchemy-dev>`_
        
        
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        0.6.1 (2011-01-08)
        ------------------
        
        * Update datamanager.mark_changed to handle sessions which have not yet logged
          a (ORM) query.
        
        
        0.6 (2010-07-24)
        ----------------
        
        * Implement should_retry for sqlalchemy.orm.exc.ConcurrentModificationError
          and serialization errors from PostgreSQL and Oracle.
          (Specify transaction>=1.1 to use this functionality.)
        
        * Include license files.
        
        * Add ``transaction_manager`` attribute to data managers for compliance with
          IDataManager interface.
        
        0.5 (2010-06-07)
        ----------------
        
        * Remove redundant session.flush() / session.clear() on savepoint operations.
          These were only needed with SQLAlchemy 0.4.x. 
        
        * SQLAlchemy 0.6.x support. Require SQLAlchemy >= 0.5.1.
        
        * Add support for running ``python setup.py test``.
        
        * Pull in pysqlite explicitly as a test dependency.
        
        * Setup sqlalchemy mappers in test setup and clear them in tear down. This
          makes the tests more robust and clears up the global state after. It
          caused the tests to fail when other tests in the same run called
          clear_mappers.
        
        0.4 (2009-01-20)
        ----------------
        
        Bugs fixed:
        
        * Only raise errors in tpc_abort if we have committed.
        
        * Remove the session id from the SESSION_STATE just before we de-reference the
          session (i.e. all work is already successfuly completed). This fixes cases
          where the transaction commit failed but SESSION_STATE was already cleared.  In
          those cases, the transaction was wedeged as abort would always error.  This
          happened on PostgreSQL where invalid SQL was used and the error caught.
        
        * Call session.flush() unconditionally in tpc_begin.
        
        * Change error message on session.commit() to be friendlier to non zope users.
        
        Feature changes:
        
        * Support for bulk update and delete with SQLAlchemy 0.5.1
        
        0.3 (2008-07-29)
        ----------------
        
        Bugs fixed:
        
        * New objects added to a session did not cause a transaction join, so were not
          committed at the end of the transaction unless the database was accessed.
          SQLAlchemy 0.4.7 or 0.5beta3 now required.
        
        Feature changes:
        
        * For correctness and consistency with ZODB, renamed the function 'invalidate' 
          to 'mark_changed' and the status 'invalidated' to 'changed'.
        
        0.2 (2008-06-28)
        ----------------
        
        Feature changes:
        
        * Updated to support SQLAlchemy 0.5. (0.4.6 is still supported).
        
        0.1 (2008-05-15)
        ----------------
        
        * Initial public release.
