Fix retro-compatibility bug


0.7.8
-----
* Added 'content' protocol handler, which will store a blob of content as the service secret.
* Added 'sflvault' protocol handler, which inherits 'content' (to store another vault's credentials)
* Added support to add a port-forwarding as part of an alias
* Major improvements to the QT client:
** Save password in QT client
** Main window remembers position and size
** Fix #3682: password show error
** Added desktop file
** Merged in Microsoft Windows version compatibility (should work, but more testing is needed)
** Updated protocol window to split arguments from the executable.
** Simplified service config interface
** Better error handling
** Revamped info-dock for a service, machine and customer.
** Added support for metadata.
* Added a minimal but important test suite
* Results are now sorted when searching (by machine name, and service URL)
* Added basic logging to the server
* Added support for metadata, for each service, with the first key, "prompt", being used by the 'sudo://', 'su://', and 'ssh://' handlers, to detect the shell prompt you'll be waiting for.  For the cases where the provided regexp weren't matching your shell.  The value for "prompt" should be a regular expression.

UPGRADE path:
* When upgrading to this version, the password stored in your Keyring will be invalidated, since a new standard and Windows-compatible way to store the password.  The new domain is "sflvault". Under Ubuntu, in Seahorse, it's in the "network credentials" section.

TODO (before release?):
* Minimal testing
* Fix coverage reporting
** Make use of SFLVAULT_IN_TEST to prevent ElGamal key generation
* Package the .desktop file in the debian client-qt package.
