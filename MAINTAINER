Steps to perform when releasing SFLvault
========================================

* Modify setup.py and change the version number, for each of the components.

* Make sure the MINIMAL_CLIENT_VERSION in server/sflvault/views.py is
  appropriate, to ensure backwards compatibility.

* Commit the release commit INCLUDING the Release Notes inside that commit.
  Note all new features and fixes.

* Step OUTSIDE of the virtualenv, with `deactivate` (otherwise, your
  virtenv's path will go in the `sflvault` executable file)

* For each module, SFLvault-common, SFLvault-server, SFLvault-client and
  SFLvault-client-qt:

  # Clear any previous dist builds.
  $ find -type d -name dist -exec rm -r {} +
  
  $ for path in common client client-qt server; do
      (cd $path && python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel)
  done

  Validate that the packages can be installed via:

  $ pip install server/dist/*.tar.gz \
      common/dist/*.tar.gz client{,-qt}/dist/*.tar.gz

  and

  $ pip install server/dist/*.whl \
      common/dist/*. client{,-qt}/dist/*.whl

* Assuming the above step worked, tag the commit with the version
  number.

* Push with tags:

  git push --tags

* Finally, upload it to PyPI:

  $ for path in common client client-qt server; do
    (cd $path && twine upload dist/*)
  done
